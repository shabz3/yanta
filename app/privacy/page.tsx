      currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
      automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
      standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future,
      we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
      privacy notice. 12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE? In Short: Yes, we
